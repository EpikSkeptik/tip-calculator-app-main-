## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


## My process
Started by mapping out the necessary components in HTML and grouping together items that need to be grouped for styling using CSS. Moved into CSS and worked from largest to smallest components and details. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Used alot of CSS Flexbox with space-between, space-around in both directions.
Also used CSS Grid for formatting the select buttons.


### Continued development

Still have to finish up the Javascript portion.
